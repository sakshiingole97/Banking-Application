# Banking-Application
A banking application that allows users to open accounts, make deposits, withdraw funds, and view their balances.

I executed the code using the Intellj app.
It will display four options during execution: the first is to open an account,the second is to deposit money, the third is to withdraw money and the fourth is to display stored information.
