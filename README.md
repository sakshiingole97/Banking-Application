# Banking-Application
A banking application that allows users to open accounts, make deposits, withdraw funds, and view their balances.

I executed the code using the Intellj app.
It will display four options during execution: the first is to open an account,the second is to deposit money, the third is to withdraw money and the fourth is to display stored information.
First, we must choose the option to open an account, after which it will request some details, such as our name and the name of our bank.The next step is to make a deposit into the account. We are able to take money out of the account as well. Additionally, it will display the account holder's name and the current balance.
